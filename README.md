# Boilerplate React Next.js TypeScript TailwindCSS
This is very easy and simple starter set of React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. Feel free to copy and use it!

## Demo
Deployed to Vercel, [here](https://boilerplate-react-nextjs-typescript.vercel.app)

## To Customise
- Favicon: src/app/favicon.ico
- TailwindCSS setting: src/globals.css
- Font: app/layout.tsx, tailwind.config.js, tailwind.config.js
- Meta data (page title, description, etc): Default is on src/app/layout.tsx and you can add to each pages.


## How to start React Next.js TypeScript TailwindCSS manually from scratch
Use this code in terminal:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest nameOfYourApp --typescript
```

Then I got such quiestions and I answered Yes to the first 4, No to the last 2:

```bash
√ Would you like to use ESLint? ... No / Yes
√ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? ... No / Yes
√ Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? ... No / Yes
√ Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) ... No / Yes
√ Would you like to use Turbopack for `next dev`? ... No / Yes
√ Would you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)? ... No / Yes
```

Once you have installed, you can follow README.md there.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
